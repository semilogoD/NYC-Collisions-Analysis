## Introduction:
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from January to August 2020. Each row of the dataset represents an individual traffic incident and includes details such as:

-	Date, Time, and Location (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude)
-	Vehicles Involved
-	Victims and Injury Severity
-	Contributing Factors (e.g., distracted driving, speeding, mechanical failure)

The goal of this project is to explore temporal and spatial accident patterns, identify high-risk factors and locations, and derive actionable insights using Microsoft Excel.

## Key Metrics:

- Month with the Most Accidents
- Street with the Most Accidents 
- Most Common Contributing Factor to Accidents
- Peak Hour for Accidents
- Peak Day of Week for Accidents

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated:

•	Data Cleaning & Preparation

•	Data Aggregation & Pivot Tables

•	Calculated Fields

•	Charts & Visualizations

## Analysis:

### % of Total Accidents by Month 

Using a pivot table grouped by month, I calculated the % share of accidents each month.

-	January and February had the highest accident counts before a noticeable decline starting in March 2020, likely due to COVID-19 lockdown measures.
-	Accidents remained lower during April–June, with a slight uptick in July and August.

 There’s a clear seasonal and pandemic-induced pattern, with traffic collisions decreasing significantly during early pandemic lockdowns.

 ### Accidents by Day of Week and Hour of Day
 
Using a pivot table grouped by Day and Time, we found the Day of the Week and Time with the highest number of reported collisions 

-	Fridays had the highest number of accidents.
-	Most collisions occurred during 5 PM.

 Accidents peak during high-traffic periods at the end of the workweek.

### Street with the Most Accidents

Using a pivot table grouped by street name, we found the street with the highest number of reported collisions.

-	The street with the most accidents was Belt Parkway, accounting for 13.12% of all reported accidents.
  
 This may indicate high traffic volume or dangerous road design. Further investigation into traffic controls and pedestrian infrastructure is warranted.

 ### Top Contributing Factors: All vs Fatal
 
Using filtering and a pivot table:

-	Most Common Factor (All Accidents):
Driver Inattention/Distraction

-	Most Common Factor (Fatal Accidents):
Unspecified

Distraction is the leading factor in general, but fatal accidents tend to involve more serious factors like alcohol or speeding.

###	Borough Breakdown

 - Brooklyn experienced higher accident rates of 33.05%.
 - Queens experienced accident rates of 25.57%.
 - Bronx experienced accident rates of 17.84%.
 - Manhattan experienced accident rates of 16.54%.
 - Staten Island experienced accident rates of 5.00%.
